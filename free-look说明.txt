by using this mod you can observe & capture your stunts very closely & clearly,
& from any distance,
because this will let you control your camera view.

controls
during stun press 'backspace' to start the mod,
then,
press 'Q' & 'W' to adjust X coordinate,
press 'A' & 'S' to adjust Y coordinate,
press 'Z' & 'X' to adjust Z coordinate,

press 'HOME' at anytime to reset camera angle
& 'END' to stop this mod at any time,

use FRAPS or any other software to take shoots of your stunts,
& you may also submit those Shots on http://vc-amazingshots.ucoz.net/
to show other your talent,
good luck,

Sorry for Bump,
